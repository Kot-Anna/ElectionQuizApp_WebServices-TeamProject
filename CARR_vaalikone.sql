In Hagrid\'s third year, he was framed by Tom Riddle for the crime of opening the Chamber of Secrets and using his pet Acromantula to attack several Muggle-born students and eventually killing one of them. Though Hagrid\'s wand was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of Hogwarts and allowed to live on the school grounds at the request of Albus Dumbledore.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Hagrid was given the task of reintroducing Harry Potter to the wizarding world. In 1993, Hagrid would assume the post of Care of Magical Creatures professor after the retirement of Professor Silvanus Kettleburn. As a member of both the original and the re-instated Order of the Phoenix, Hagrid fought in several battles of the First and the Second Wizarding Wars, including the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. By 2017, he was still living, and presumably still teaching and tending to his gamekeeping duties at Hogwarts, inviting Harry\'s son Albus Severus for tea when he joined the school as Harry informed him at the station, just as Hagrid had done to his father, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.','Hagrid: \"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\'t stop him. Stop Lily an\' James Potter\'s son goin\' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\'s been down ever since he was born. He\'s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world.

His physical prowess, technical ingenuity, and tactical thinking make him an incredibly dangerous opponent. He is also a founding member of the Justice League.','His parents died when he was so young. Shot. Killed right in front of him. He was raised alone. A kid in a huge mansion. With his memories of his mother and father. He had love, and they took it from him. He should be a killer. He should want to tear the world apart for what it did. And yet he took that pain.

He is a mutant who possesses animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, a powerful regenerative ability known as a healing factor, and three retractable claws in each hand. Wolverine has been depicted variously as a member of the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the Avengers.','The character appeared in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 before having a larger role in #181 (cover-dated November 1974). He was created by Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas,[2] writer Len Wein,[3] and Marvel art director John Romita Sr. Romita designed the character\'s costume, but the character was first drawn for publication by Herb Trimpe. Wolverine then joined a revamped version of the superhero team the X-Men, where eventually writer Chris Claremont and artist-writer John Byrne would play significant roles in the character\'s development. Artist Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont and helped revise the character with a four-part eponymous limited series from September to December 1982, which debuted Wolverine\'s catchphrase, \"I\'m the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn\'t very nice.\"','/img/wolverine.jpg','1617704923139'),(12,'Minerva','McGonagall','London',65,'Teacher','Hogwart','Professor Minerva McGonagall, O.M.

During her seventh year, she was appointed Head Girl.\r\n\r\nAfter her education, Minerva worked for two years at the Ministry of Magic and later returned to Hogwarts, where she became Head of Gryffindor House and the Transfiguration professor. Though she wasn\'t a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War, Minerva greatly helped the Ministry of Magic\'s resistance through spying on Death Eaters and bringing the Aurors crucial information on their activities.','Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts.
